# Enzymatic and Physiological Response Analysis in Rice Genotypes

## Overview
This repository contains R scripts and associated data used to analyze enzymatic and physiological responses in rice genotypes under different treatments and time points. The analyses include:

- **Enzyme activities:** Superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase, and Î²-1,3-glucanase.
- **Physiological parameters:** Chlorophyll content and electrolyte leakage.
- **Disease score assessment** for rice genotypes.

High-resolution plots are automatically generated and saved in the `Results` folder.
